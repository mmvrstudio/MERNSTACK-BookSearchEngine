### Description 
    With Google Books API I was able to build a search engine into a GraphQL API, built with the Apollo Server. This web application uses MERNSTACK, MongoDB database and Node on the back end, and React at the front end. To be completed I used the Express.js server and API.
  
## Deployed App: 



## Installation:
    $ git clone git@github.com:mmvrstudio/MERNSTACK-BookSearchEngine.git
    $ cd MERNSTACK-BookSearchEngine
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
    $ node index.js
